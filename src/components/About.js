          My name is Grace Mora, and I'm a 24-year-old from Michigan. I
          graduated from Michigan State University in 2023 with a Bachelor's
          Degree in Computer Science, alongside a cognate in Psychology. In my
          free time, I enjoy camping, practicing yoga, and spending quality time
          with my cat, Noodle.

          I designed and developed this website from the ground up, driven by my
          passion for creativity and technology. As I look to the future, Iâ€™m
          excited to pursue a career in project management, where I can combine
          my love for learning with my dedication to hard work. I hope you enjoy
          exploring my page!
